== Introduction

IMPORTANT: _source : this tutorial is inspired on the https://gradle.org/[Gradle] official Documentation_
and on a lab done internaly for http://ninja-squad.com[NinjaSquad] by the famous https://twitter.com/jbnizet[@jbnizet]

IMPORTANT: _source : the Gradle official Documentation_

https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework[Gradle] is a popular, open-source build tool like Ant or Maven with nice features :
>>>>>>> 154fa72... initial commit with adoc doc and html rendering

* Build-by-convention as Maven. But we never lock you in!
* Very powerful support for multi-project builds.
* Very powerful dependency management (based on Apache Ivy).
* Full support for your existing Maven or Ivy repository infrastructure.
* Support for transitive dependency management without the need for remote repositories or pom.xml and ivy.xml files.

== Why a build tool?

* to compile your project but not only
* to generate your delivery package (.war, .jar, ...) and deploy it!
* to generate the doc
* to run the tests
* to generate the quality reports
* ...

"`My IDE can't do this?`"

"`Only some of these tasks Dud! And a lot of manual configuration, without scripting, and not shareable`"

== Why automate?

* Write once, run everywhere
* Do not forget, not be mistaken
* Continuous Integration
* Deployment with confidence

TIP: During the whole lab, you're going to practise Gradle and you would need the official doc, so open it :
https://docs.gradle.org/{gradle-version}/userguide/introduction.html

== What are the differences between Maven and Gradle

Maven brought good ideas :

* plugins
* convention over configuration
* standard cycle standard
* dependency management

But...

* XML ;-(
* Verbose
* Rigid
* Bad documentation

[[getting-started]]
== Getting started - Fast!

IMPORTANT: Be sure of having a GitHub account!

Clone the GitHub Project : https://github.com/acrepet/killerapp.git

Check your local workspace, import the project into IDEA (File -> New -> Project From Existing Sources -> Import Project from external model -> Gradle)

image::img/importgradleproject.png[]

Your `build.gradle` (at root of your app) file should look like this and let you to configure the object Project

[source, groovy, subs="+attributes", title="build.gradle"]
----
group 'emse'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

apply plugin: 'java'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
}


----
You can now open a new console and run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build

_gradlew_ is the gradle wrapper (see below)

and try to build your project via IDEA -> right click on build.gradle -> Run Build

== Wrapper

Problems :

* Most tools require installation on your computer before you can use them. If the installation is easy, you may think that’s fine. But it can be an unnecessary burden on the users of the build.
* Will the team members install the right version of the tool for the build? What if they’re building an old version of the software?
* You have to fix a bug in a version of two years ago, which version of gradle is used for this old project

The Gradle Wrapper (henceforth referred to as the “Wrapper”) solves these problems and is the preferred way of starting a Gradle build.

Wrapper ?

* a jar : ~50 KBs
* a property file
* a gradlew.bat file(Windows)
* a gradlew file (Unix, MacOS)

These files are saved with all the sources (with Git of course!)

== Gradle's Anatomy

* Projects

* Tasks

* Dependency Resolution

* Lifecycle

== Gradle Project

* "build.gradle" configures the project

* Project provides the base DSL (Domain Specific Language)

* Build steps are performed by Tasks

* Plugins provide preconfigured tasks


== Task

* Define what we have to do, perform an action
* A lot of predefined and configurable tasks
* A task could depend on another task or several tasks

== Build LifeCycle

A Gradle build has three distinct phases :

*Initialization*
During this phase, Gradle determines which projects are going to take part in the build (through build.gradle files). Gradle supports single and multi-project builds), and creates a Project instance for each of these projects.

*Configuration*
During this phase Gradle parse the build file's configuration (several files could be parsed). The project objects are configured. The build scripts of all projects which are part of the build are executed.

*Execution*
Gradle executes the task graph -> determines the subset of the tasks, created and configured during the configuration phase, to be executed. The subset is determined by the task name arguments passed to the gradle command and the current directory. Gradle then executes each of the selected tasks.


== Dependencies between tasks

* All the tasks create a DAG
* DAG = Directed Acyclic Graph

Append these lines to your build.gradle file :

[source, groovy, title="tasks dependencies"]
----
task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello'
    }
}

task world(dependsOn: hello) {
    doLast {
        println 'World'
    }
}
----

Then, run :

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew hello
----

and :

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew world
----

Try to replace :

[source, groovy, title="tasks dependencies"]
----
task world(dependsOn: hello) {
    doLast {
        println 'World'
    }
}
----

by these lines :

[source, groovy, title="tasks dependencies"]
----
task world(dependsOn: hello) {
    println 'World'
}
----

Then, run :

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew world
----

== Which tasks exist?

Clean and refator your build.gradle. Keep only these lines :

[source, groovy, subs="+attributes", title="build.gradle"]
----
group 'emse'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
----

Then, run :

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks

== Plugins

* Add tasks to the project
* Under conventions
* Let configure added tasks
* We can add new tasks and dependencies!

[source, groovy, , title="plugin Java"]
----
apply plugin : 'java'

Effect of this line :

image::img/javaPluginConfigurations.png[]

== Run

2 steps

1. Configuration :

* Which tasks exist?
* A graph of dependencies?

2. Run
• Depends on arguments, run the right tasks

== More tasks ?

Append these lines to your build.gradle file

[source, groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'java'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
}

println 'This is executed during the configuration phase.'

task configured {
    println 'This is also executed during the configuration phase.'
}

task testWrite {
    doLast {
        println 'This is executed during the execution phase.'
    }
}

task testWriteBoth {
    doFirst {

== Dependencies

If your build script needs to use external libraries, you can add them to the script's classpath in the build script itself. You do this using the buildscript() method, passing in a closure which declares the build script classpath.

Example :

[source, groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone' }
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.0.0.M3'
    }
}
----

You can add dependencies and repositories in your build.gradle file :
[source, groovy]
----

dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    testCompile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}
----

and try to run :

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew dependencies
----
